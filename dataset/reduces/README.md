This folder contains simplified meshes corresponding to models being used in the lab study. Each model file, either `.fbx` or `.obj` has a suffix that represents a targeted reduction ratio (the actual reduction ratio may differ due to algorithmic instability).

The complete dataset folder (62.42 GB) can be downloaded from [changkun.de/s/infloop/dataset](https://changkun.de/s/infloop/dataset).
